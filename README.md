# Shopify Tracker
Littledata's tracking script for Shopify stores

Dependencies
---

These scripts rely on `LittledataLayer` window-scope variable generated by a snippet in the Shopify store theme

Configuration
---

The following fields of the `LittledataLayer` object allow for finer configuration of tracking features:

*anonymizeIp* (default `true`)
This field to instructs the gtag library to [mask the last 3 numbers of the user's IP address](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052), to support greater user privacy at the expense of some geo-location accuracy.

*googleSignals* (default `true`)
This field opts your site into using [Google Signals](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7532985?hl=en), to enable more powerful demographic reports and cross-device tracking using the Google Ads cookie. You need to check this is compatible with your website terms of use.

*productClicks* (default `true`)
By default our tracking code briefly interrupts a click on a product in a product list, in order to send the tracking event before the page reloads. If this is interfering with other apps or scripts you can turn off product list click tracking.
