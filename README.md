# Shopify Tracker
Littledata's tracking script for Shopify stores.

Shopify apps:
---

- [Google Analytics by Littledata](https://apps.shopify.com/littledata)

- [Segment.com by Littedata](https://apps.shopify.com/segment-com-by-littledata)


Dependencies
---

These scripts rely on `LittledataLayer` window-scope variable generated by a snippet in the Shopify store theme


Configuration
---

The following fields of the `LittledataLayer` object allow for finer configuration of tracking features:

**anonymizeIp**

This field to instructs the gtag library to [mask the last 3 numbers of the user's IP address](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052), to support greater user privacy at the expense of some geo-location accuracy.

Default: `true`


**googleSignals**

This field opts your site into using [Google Signals](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7532985?hl=en), to enable more powerful demographic reports and cross-device tracking using the Google Ads cookie. You need to check this is compatible with your website terms of use.

Default: `true`


**productClicks**

By default our tracking code briefly interrupts a click on a product in a product list, in order to send the tracking event before the page reloads. If this is interfering with other apps or scripts you can turn off product list click tracking.

Default: `true`
